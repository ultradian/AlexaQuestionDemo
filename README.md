These are files for a talk I gave on March 29, 2018.
* `index.js` is the code that should be uploaded to Amazon Lambda, or whereever your endpoint is located. Your `node_modules` will go there too, as defined in `package.json`
* `model.json` is the interaction model which should be uploaded to the Amazon developer portal by pasting into the developer console or uploading using the `ask api` CLI
